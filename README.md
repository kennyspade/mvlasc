**Additional Requirements for ECNL / NPL / ECNL-RL Games**

ECNL and NPL / ENCL-RL games have additional requirements as outlined in the NorCal Handbooks. MVLA provides equipment to meet these requirements, and it is up to your team to arrange for a volunteer or volunteers to pick up this equipment on the day of your game or coordinate with other teams for a handoff between games. Because this equipment is shared between teams, you must only pick up the equipment allocated to your team on the dates designated to avoid conflicts.

Please note that for ECNL games, teams must provide their own ice and water for every game. This will often end up with extra bottles of water left over at the end of the day. Feel free to leave these in the storage unit at Graham Middle School or offer them to anyone at the game who would like to take them home, but do not leave them at the field.
